# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome here.. 
Created a path finding visualizer just because of pure fascination towards several pathfinding algorithms, built using React.
 
You can select the source, destination and a set of obstacles you want the path to avoid, 
Choose the algorithm you wish to visualize the path from.

#Algorithms Used

Dijkstra's Algorithm: The most well known algorithm; this pathfinding algorithm guarantees the shortest path

A Star Algorithm : arguably the best algorithm uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path and faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.

DFS Algorithm : A vert bad algorithm for path finding does not guarantee shortest path.


Please find below attached GIFs's of several algorithms.
